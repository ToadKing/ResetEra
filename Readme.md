# ResetEra Scripts

Because why not.

## Scripts

* [Inline Refresh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToadKing/ResetEra/master/resetera-inline-refresh.user.js) - Makes the refresh link dynamically add new posts instead of reloading the whole page. **New Feature!** Now refreshes posts when you hit "R".
* [Fix Unread Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToadKing/ResetEra/master/resetera-fix-unread-icon.user.js) - Makes some small positioning changes to the unread icon. Makes it centered in its area and makes the clickable region larger. Good for mobile.
* [Topic Link to Unread](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ToadKing/ResetEra/master/resetera-topic-link-to-unread.user.js) - Changes the behavior of the topic title hyperlink back to linking to the last unread post. Adds a link to jump to the first post as well.
